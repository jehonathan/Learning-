# ðŸ“˜ Learning

Welcome to the **Learning** repository!

This repository is a personal knowledge base and resource hub where I document and organize the materials I use while taking deep dives into various technical and non-technical topics. The goal is to centralize my learning process, track my progress, and make it easier to revisit or share useful content in the future.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

- Store notes, code snippets, and summaries from books, articles, courses, and videos.
- Track topic-specific deep dives across random areas of interest.
- Maintain a structured and searchable resource for lifelong learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each top-level directory represents a topic or learning track. Inside each, you'll typically find:

- `notes.md` â€“ Personal notes or summaries
- `resources.md` â€“ Links to courses, books, and articles
- `code/` â€“ Sample code, experiments, and exercises
- `projects/` â€“ Mini-projects or case studies

Example:
Learning/
â”œâ”€â”€ web-dev/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ notes.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ resources.md
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ code/
â”œâ”€â”€ linux/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ compilers/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
