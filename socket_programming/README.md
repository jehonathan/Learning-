# ðŸ”Œ Socket Programming in Python

Welcome to the **Socket Programming** repository!

This repo is a focused exploration of Python's built-in `socket` module. It is based primarily on the excellent Real Python guide:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Python Socket Programming: Client/Server Applications](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/#multi-connection-client-and-server)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To gain a deeper understanding of low-level network communication in Python by:

- Studying the `socket` module in detail
- Building basic to advanced client-server applications
- Implementing multi-connection servers using `select`
- Experimenting with both TCP and UDP protocols

---

## ðŸ“š Resource

All the learning content and code in this repo is derived from:  
ðŸ“– **Real Python** â€“ [Python Sockets: Handling Multiple Connections](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/#multi-connection-client-and-server)

---

## ðŸ§  Topics Explored

* Sockets and their types (`SOCK_STREAM`, `SOCK_DGRAM`)
* TCP vs UDP
* Blocking vs Non-blocking sockets
* Handling multiple clients with `select.select()`
* Graceful error handling and shutdown
* Real-world use cases and patterns

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* No external libraries needed (`socket` is part of the standard library)
